Benchmarking is done using the schema below:

![Blog Schema](blog-db.png)

The tables are populated with the following amount of records when the migrations are successfully executed:

- authors will have 10,000 records
- comments will have 59,700 records
- posts will have 49,950 records
- posts_tags will have 249,500â€¬ records
- summaries will have 49,950 records
- tags will have 10,000 records

The migrations take about 1 to 2 minutes to run.
